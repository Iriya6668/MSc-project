# MSc-project
The project is based on a driving simulator that is under development by the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds. As the driving simulator is still under development (expected to be published on 09/24) the repository therefore only contains the shaders I created, the weather effects prefabs, and the weather system editor that I wrote and some of the scripting components it will use, and doesn't contain scenes from the driving simulator. Nevertheless, using the shaders in the repository, it is possible to create the desired weather visual effects, such as wet roads, surfaces with snow and rain windows.
